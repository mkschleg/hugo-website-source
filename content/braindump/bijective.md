A bijection is a function between two sets where each element in the [preimage]({{< relref "image.md" >}}) has exactly one element in the [image]({{< relref "image.md" >}}) and visa versa. This means all elements in the preimage and all objects in the image have a unique pair which the function transforms from preimage set to image set. A bijective mapping is both [surjective]({{< relref "surjective.md" >}}) and [injective]({{< relref "injective.md" >}}).

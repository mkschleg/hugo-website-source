Machine Learning is the general study of teaching machines from examples. There are many [Types of Learning]({{< relref "types_of_learning.md" >}}), but the typical style studied in classical machine learning textbooks is [Supervised Learning]({{< relref "supervised_learning.md" >}}), with brief explorations into [Semi-supervised Learning]({{< relref "semi_supervised_learning.md" >}}) and [Unsupervised Learning]({{< relref "unsupervised_learning.md" >}}).

This note will act as a central note for basic concepts in machine learning, and will show all the notes linking back to this topic.

A representation is in a sense a vector of features or a symbol which (ideally) uniquely correspond to an object (i.e. a noun) and properties of said object (verbs, descriptors, etc...). Many modern interpretations of a representation are often traced back to [Charles S. Peirce]({{< relref "charles_s_peirce.md" >}})'s [Semiotics]({{< relref "peirce_semiotic.md" >}}).


## The Representational Theory of Mind {#the-representational-theory-of-mind}

source
: <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/index.html#Representational>

This theory of mind takes mental states (i.e. internal beliefs, perceptions, thoughts, etc..) as a basis. These states are said to have _intentionality_, which means they _refer to things_ (i.e. representations).

This theory then understands cognition as sequences of representations (intentional mental states).

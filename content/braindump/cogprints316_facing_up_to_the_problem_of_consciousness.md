Chalmer's argues that there is a non-reductive explanation for consciousness, which could lead us to a naturalistic account. The main points of the paper are clearly laid out in the introductory paragraph


## Separating the Hard and Easy problems {#separating-the-hard-and-easy-problems}

The first goal Chalmer's sets out to accomplish is the seperation of the _hard_ problem (those not explainable through cognitive sciences) and the _easy_ problem (those which are explainable through cognitive sciences). He suggest to separate these categories into "consciousness" and "awareness" respectively, but I will continue the use of _hard_ and _easy_ in the following passages.

The easy problem, according to Chalmer's, is quite simply the explanation of 7 sub-problems of intelligence:

1.  The ability to discriminate, categorize, and react to the environment
2.  The integration of information (or learning) of a cognitive system
3.  The reportability of mental (internal) states
    -   This bothers me a bit. Can we actually report on our internal states, or only report the stories or our explanations of what might be our internal states.
4.  The ability of a system to access its own internal states
    -   Access in what sense?
5.  The focus of attention
    -   I'm unsure what this means. Being able to focus or attend to one task at a time?
6.  The deliberate control of behaviour
    -   Deliberate in what sense. Do we actually control behavior, or are we just dynamical systems?
7.  The difference between wakefulness and sleep

Chalmer's claims these can be explained scientifically, and I tend to agree with him (not considering my misgivings if some of the above are parts of the _easy_ problem).

-   To explain the integration of information, we need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and exploited by later processes (learning, neurophysiological changes).
-   To account for sleep and wakefulness, and appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for contrasting behaviour in those states is enough.

He describes the _hard_ problem as the subjective aspect of experience. When we think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is also an experiential aspect. An aspect which we feel as experience. There is _something it is like_ to be a conscious organism. This phenomena has been described with terms as 'phenomenal consciousness' and 'qualia', but he uses _conscious experience_.


## Functional Explanation {#functional-explanation}

Chalmer's perportes that experience can not be explained as a mechanism or function. This is what distiguishes the hard from the easy problems. He then laysout how we report the performance of a function, specifically looking at describing a mechanism which entails the function. He argues that if we can describe a natural mechanism which explains the function, this function is explainable and known. I agree with the later part of the argument, but not the former. I'm unsure what "experience" actually is, and don't buy this statement without doubt. I don't see why experience is different from other functions describable by cognitive science. It _feels_ different, sure, but that does not mean it is different. His argument rests on this claim, which is not well supported.


## Some Case-Studies {#some-case-studies}

Here he goes into some failed theories on conciousness, relaying the reader agrees with the notion that experience is not a function. Some of the examples are interesting, but for briefness I will skip them for now.


## Non-reductive Explanations {#non-reductive-explanations}

This is where chalmer's really lost me. He discussed the only way to create a theory of consciousness was to

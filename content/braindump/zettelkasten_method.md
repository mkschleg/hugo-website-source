This is a method for note taking developed by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann). There are several principles under which the method derives it's workflow:

-   Your notes should be atomic: This means topics should be placed into a single note, <span class="underline">but</span> the scope of the topic should be small. This makes it easier to link and categorize throughout your notes.
-   Your notes (or collection of notes) should be interconnected: This means you should continually make connections with notes previously written and place new notes into this structure.

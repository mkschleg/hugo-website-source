**definition**: An isomorphism is a mapping between two mathematical groups which maintains sets and relations of the elements of the groups. If two mathematical objects have an isomorphism this means they are effectively the same objects after all the elements are renamed (through the isomorph mapping). More formally an isomorphism is a [bijective]({{< relref "bijective.md" >}}) [morphism]({{< relref "morphism.md" >}}).

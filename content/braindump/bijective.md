A bijection is a function between two sets where each element in the [preimage]({{<relref "image.md#" >}}) has exactly one element in the [image]({{<relref "image.md#" >}}) and visa versa. This means all elements in the preimage and all objects in the image have a unique pair which the function transforms from preimage set to image set. A bijective mapping is both [surjective]({{<relref "surjective.md#" >}}) and [injective]({{<relref "injective.md#" >}}).

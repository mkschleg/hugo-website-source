: [Note-Taking]({{< relref "note_taking" >}})

This is a method for note taking developed by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas%5FLuhmann). There are several principles under which the method derives it's workflow:

-   Your notes should be atomic: This means topics should be placed into a single note, <span class="underline">but</span> the scope of the topic should be small. This makes it easier to link and categorize throughout your notes.
-   Your notes (or collection of notes) should be interconnected: This means you should continually make connections with notes previously written and place new notes into this structure.

Instead consider if you had another brain, which you could organize and have topics surface when you need them. This is the idea behind the [Zettelkasten method]({{< relref "zettelkasten_method" >}}). This is where org-roam comes in.

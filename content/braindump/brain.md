The brain is a complex system of interconnected [Neurons]({{< relref "neurons.md" >}}) resulting in complex behavior in cognitive systems. The study of the electrical impulses of the brain is called [Neuroscience]({{< relref "neuroscience.md" >}}), the systems level study of the brain is known as [Cognitive Science]({{< relref "cognitive_science.md" >}}), the study of the resulting behavior in organisms is called [Behavioral Science]({{< relref "behavioral_science.md" >}}), and finally the study of human behavior (and then associated treatment) is called [Psychology]({{< relref "psychology.md" >}}).

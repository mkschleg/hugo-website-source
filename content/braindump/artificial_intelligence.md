[Intelligence]({{<relref "intelligence.md#" >}})

There are various forms of Artificial Intelligence, or what is thought to be artificial intelligence. It is a large field with many varying opinions. While my personal bent is towards [Reinforcement Learning]({{<relref "reinforcement_learning.md#" >}}), this doesn't preclude the large probability that other studies can enlighten our approaches brining a different perspective. In this note, I hope to go through various forms of AI over the past century, touching on various notable conversations that have occurred.
